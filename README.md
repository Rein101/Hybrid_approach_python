## Introduction

Suicide deaths, ideation and attempts have become a rampant reality all around the globe. With the increasing number of what most people term as ‘noise’, which is external factors like the decreasing want for oneness and technological advancements especially social media, most people have fallen victim to these instances. Luckily, there are those that are able to seek help, but the percentage is not one to be proud of. In Kenya alone, the suicide death rate is at 6.1 per every 100,000 people, as per the last update by the World Health Organization (WHO).
This project is aimed at investigate the most affected gender in Kenya, and forecast A ARIMA(P,D,Q) model in order to assess whether the trend will move in an upward trend. It is assumed that a greater percentage of suicide rates in the data is as a result of poor mental health, and aims at coming at a conclusion on how to combat depression.
It is also based in the assumptions that corona virus is not a factor due to the insufficiency and unavailability of the data correlating to the corona virus pandemic.
The analytical methods in use are time series and logistic regression model to project and forecast the data under investigation, and check whether gender is a significant factor.


## Features
Two datasets are in use:
For Time series: clean.csv
Features: date = in years
          Male = represents the male population in rates (per 100000) that have committed suicide
          Female = represents the female population in rates (per 100000) that have committed suicide
          Total = represents the total population in rates (per 100000) that have committed suicide
For Logistic Regression: gender_suicide.csv
Features: year
          gender
          suicide_rates


## Installation

The data is readily available in the link below:

## Usage

This project is for learning purposes only. The findings may not be accurate, and since the dataset is small, there is a high risk of overfitting. hence, in no way must one use the data to make inference or decisions.
